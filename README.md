3. Open Cmd/Powershell/Terminal in the main folder (src)
4. Open the config.json file and
    - Insert your GuildID (Testing Server)
    - Token (The thing that makes bots work)
    - ClientID (Another thing that makes bots work)
5. Type `npm i` to fill up 1.9PB of useless files
6. Go to the slashcommands folder and 
    - Type `node localdeploycommands` to put SlashCommands in your defined guild 
    - Or `node globaldeploycommands` to put Global slash commands
